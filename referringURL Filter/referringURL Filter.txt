/*

If you want to check if the referring URL matches any one of multiple allowed URLs, 
you can modify the script to use an array of allowed URLs and check 
if the referring URL is in that array.  
This javascript code is used to check if the referring URL includes any of the allowed URLs in the array. 
If the condition is met, the script does nothing. Otherwise, it redirects to Google after a 5-second delay. 
You can easily add or remove URLs from the allowedURLs array as needed.
